Digital signal processing is the processing of signals inside a
digital system.  Signals can be a number of things. Generally you
can think of them as a constant stream of data.

There are a number of different reasons we would want to modify a
signal.  We could process our data signal in order to find out
information about signal itself, what it represents, or something
about it's surroundings.

If we are talking about dsp in regards to audio data, we will
generally be doing one of two things, processing the stream into a
data format which we can do something with. Or modifying the
stream itself.

The two main "Domains" we will be working withing are the
frequency domain and the time domain. An algorithm called a Fast
fourier transform, allows us to move between them in an effective
way. Let's start by defining what each of these are and what we 
might do while working within each of these domains.

Let's start with the Time Domain.






Now onto the frequency Domain.

One instance where we might want to work within the frequency domain would be
to visualize some audio data. We can analyze

A good delineation to take between these two domains would be:

Time domain, where the audio is graphed as a function of samples over time.
Frequency domain, where audio is graphed as a function of magnitude over frequency.

In order to help visualize this. When thinking of Frequency Domain, you can
think of the spectral analyzers on an old boom box.

When thinking of Time domain, you can picture a big waveform. A line spanning peaks
and plataus.
